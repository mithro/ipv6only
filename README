connectivity, and that their IP address is.

Set Up
=========================================================================
Setting up your own copy of ipv6only.me is relatively simple.

Step 1 - Create an IPv6 only DNS name. It should *only* have AAAA
         records.

	 The ipv6only.me domain is complete IPv6 only, it doesn't even
	 use IPv4 for DNS resolution (see the include example.hosts
	 file). This makes sure that every part in the user's pipeline
	 is correctly IPv6 enabled. I highly recommend this is you
         want to be absolutely certain their IPv6 setup is complete.

Step 2 - Deploy the application to Apache (with PHP installed) at the
         root directory of your new IPv6 website.

Step 3 - (Optional) If you want to see who ends up at your website
	 enable Google Analytics by creating a PHP file with the
         following contents;
         --\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/--
         <?php
         $analytics = 'YOUR UA ID GOES HERE';
         --/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\-/\--

Step 4 - Test it all works!
